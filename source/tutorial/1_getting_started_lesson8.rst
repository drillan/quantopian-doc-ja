Backtest Analysis
-----------------

Once your backtest has finished running, click on the "Notebook" tab.

This will display a Research notebook with the following code:


.. code:: python

    bt = get_backtest('5a4e4faec73c4e44f218170a')
    bt.create_full_tear_sheet()


Note: The alpha-numeric string in your notebook will be different than the one shown above. This string is your backtest's unique identifier within Quantopian. It can also be found in the URL of the full backtest results page.


Executing this cell (Shift+Enter) will load data generated by your backtest into the research notebook, and use it to create a Pyfolio tear sheet. `Pyfolio <https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/portfolio-analysis>`__ is Quantopian's open source tool for portfolio and risk analysis. It provides a number of visualization tools that are designed to help you better understand your algorithm's behavior and risk exposures over time.


For example, the plot below shows our portfolio's rolling exposure to the market over time. One of the reasons we wanted to construct a long-short equity trading algorithm was to maintain a low correlation to the market, so we want this plot to be consistently around 0 over the entire backtesting period.

Another interesting part of the tear sheet is the Performance Attribution section. The plot below uses `Quantopian's Risk Model <https://www.quantopian.com/risk-model>`__ to illustrate how much of the returns can be attributed to your strategy, and how much of it comes from common risk factors.

We can see above that most of our portfolio's total returns come from specific returns. This suggests the algorithm's performance isn't coming from exposure to common risk factors, which is a good thing.
